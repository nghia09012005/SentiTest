          The SentiTest project was born out of a deep desire to better understand customer emotions and actual feedback in the food and beverage (F&B) industry. The starting point was identifying a gap in accurately measuring real customer satisfaction, especially when they experience newly launched products. The team believes that capturing immediate emotional reactions is the key for F&B businesses to optimize their products and services.
